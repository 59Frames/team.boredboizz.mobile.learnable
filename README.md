A revolutionary way to view your exam, homework and event dates.

## Idea

Who does not know it as a student, in the evening one lies relaxed in bed and suddenly remembers that tomorrow an exam is due. With Learnable we want to change that. The mobile application reminds you early enough of upcoming exams, homework or events. In addition to the events, you can also view your study plan and the lecturers responsible.

## Getting Started

1.  Pull Git
2.  Run ``` flutter packages get ```
3.  Launch Application
